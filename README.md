# Jack-O-pumpkin

This was meant to be a Desktop game. In the spirit of Halloween, we made our main protoganist a pumpkin named Jack. Jack's goal is to survive for as long as possible as ghosts and "Boo!"s would come to attack him. If Jack is hit by one of the ghosts or "Boo!"s, Jack will die immediately. Or current version, allows Jack to roam around the screen while ghosts and "Boo!"s are randomly generated. However, Jack is currently immortal and will never die regardless of what he hits on the screen. 

The majority of the work done in our project is contained within GameScene.swiftPhotos of Jack, dead Jack, ghosts, and "Boo!"s are within photos.

Note all drawings were made by our team.
